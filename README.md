In the modern era of technology, integrating state-of-the-art technologies together across different fields is
a necessity.This project focuses on the extraction of valuable information from High-Resolution Remote
Sensing(RS-HR) images. The objective of this project is to develop a methodology for feature extraction
and semantic segmentation for RS-HR images, using Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine learning (ML)
techniques.
 The methodology used here centers on Semantic Segmentation, a computer science technique
in which assigns semantic labels to each and every pixel in an image. Deep learning architectures, mainly
the U-Net model is used, the project aims to precisely classify the objects and features of RS-HR images.
This method has various applications from land cover mapping to object detection, with implications from
urban planning to disaster management.
 The proposed methodology is brought to life by utilizing cloud computing services, specifically
Amazon Web Services(AWS), including S3 bucket for dataset storage and Amazon SageMaker for model
training and deployment. The flexibility of cloud based solutions are ascension for handling the RS-HR
images.
 A major emphasis is pleased in achieving high accuracy and reliability in the segmentation of
RS-HR images. After conducting various experimentation and validation, the developed methodology aims
to set new benchmarks for existing approaches for the analysis of remote sensing images.The main goal is
to help provide various researchers, government or non government organizations with precise insights
from the remote sensing imagery, contributing to effective and sustainable development.
 Additionally, this project contributes to the new perspective of integration of the RS-HR images
with AI and ML.By showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning approaches in remote sensing images, it
underlines to potential of interdisciplinary research in addressing various easy as well as complex
challenges
 In conclusion, the project aims to signify the full potential of remote sensing high resolution
data in the modern times. Through this fusion of remote sensing images with deep learning brought to life
by amazon AWS services, it lays the foundation for remote sensing high resolution data to be utilized in
diverse real life applications, aiding better understanding and greater development.
